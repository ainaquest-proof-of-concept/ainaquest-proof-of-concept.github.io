<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Aina Quest Proof of Concept </h1>

## Project Description
Proof of Concept is an easily accessible mobile app that fosters kinship with plants. Users can identify plants by scanning them in real-life environments and learn about them through collectible cards generated by genAI.

We are working to implement a point-based reward system and leaderboard to create a more interactive and engaging experience for users.  Users can earn points by scanning and identifying plants which will contribute to their ranking on the leaderboard.  The number of points gained will depend on the type of plant (canoe, native, or invasive) - encouraging users to learn more about the plants in their local environment.
