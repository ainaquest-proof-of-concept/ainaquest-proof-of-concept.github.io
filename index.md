<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Project Description </h1>
**Proof of Concept**  is an easily accessible mobile app designed to foster a deeper connection with the natural world-specifically, the plants that surround us. With this app, users can simply point their mobile device at a plant in any real-life environment to quickly identify it. Upon scanning, the app generates a collectible card for the plant, providing interesting facts, care tips, and ecological information.

We are actively developing a dynamic point-based reward system and interactive leaderboard. This system not only gamifies plant identification, but also encourages users to explore and learn about the diverse flora in their local area. Users earn points through every successful plant scan and identification, with the points varying based on the plant's category (canoe, native, or invasive). This encourages users to gain a deeper understanding of their environment.

### Week 1 (Jan 27, 2025) 
**Kick-Off Week**
We began this project with a brainstorming session to explore multiple creative directions. This included:
1. **Plant Card Game**: Gamified approach of collecting and trading cards
2. **Point and Leaderboard System** Methods to award users based on amount of plants identified, fostering friendly competition.
3. **Virtual Garden**: An ability to visualize what the user has collected over time.

### Week 2 (Feb 3, 2025)
After evaluating our initial ideas, we decided to focus on collecting plants on a **Point and Leaderboard** system. During this week, our team refined the concept, and began outlining the data structures and scoring mechanisms that will form the backbone of the interactive leaderboard.

### Week 3 (Feb 10, 2025) 

**Weekly Tasks:**
1. **Integration:**
   Worked to get last semester's codebase running for all members.
2. **API Exploration:**
   We dove deeper into the API used by the previous team to understand its strengths and limitations, streamlining the process.
3. **Leaderboard Implementation:**
   Initial coding efforts began to lay the groundwork for the leaderboard page, setting up the UI framework and basic logic.

### Week 4 (Feb 17, 2025)

**Weekly Tasks:**
1. **Legacy Support:**
   Ensured the last semesters was fully operational for Delsin and Lloyd
2. **API and Hosting Transition:**
   We began migrating the PlantNet API integration transferring DigitalOcean hosting responsibilities from the previous team to now.
3. **Enhanced Leaderboard Functionality:**
   Further development on the leaderboard's functionality was undertaken, including creation of the UI and point allocation.

### Week 5 (Feb 24, 2025)
**Weekly Tasks:**
1. **Global vs. Friends Leaderboard:**
   Held detailed discussions to define the goals and metrics for implementing a dual leaderboard system-one for friends-based rankings and another for global standings.
2. **Profile Page Initialization:**
   Introduced and finalized concepts for the profile page to enhance user personalization and engagement.
3. **Plant Reference Database:**
   A preliminary list of plants was compiled to serve as in-app references, ensuring capture has a defined dataset.
4. **Camera Functionality:**
   Initial steps were taken to integrate and optimize the camera functionality, the key for scanning and identifying plants, as previously it was reported to have bugs pertaining to its responsiveness
